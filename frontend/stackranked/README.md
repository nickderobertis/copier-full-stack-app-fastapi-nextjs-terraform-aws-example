copier-full-stack-app-fastapi-nextjs-terraform-aws-example Next.js web frontend

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Developing

### Google Sign In

Note that the Google Sign in functionality will not work on preview builds by default, as we need to manually set
allowed origins in the Google Console. If you need it to work in preview, go to the Google admin console and
add the preview URL to the list of allowed origins. It will work in development already by default.
